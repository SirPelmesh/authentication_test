## Description
In the sign-in section of the Altoro Mutual website we can find an authorization form. The task is to conduct several tests for this form.<br>
Therefore, three tests were created:
<ol>
<li>a test with input of valid data,</li>
<li>a test with input of invalid data,</li>
<li>a test with input of only one field (with a username, in our case).</li>
</ol>
The last one should trigger JavaScript alert.

The test uses a pattern PageObject, so:
<ul>
<li>The class Locators from PageObject.py contains username,password fields and submit button locators. </li>
<li>The class AuthForm from PageObject.py contains functions for finding locators from class Locators and interacting with them.</li>
<li>The class BasePage from page.py contains functions for interaction with the browser.</li>
<li>The conftest.py contains a fixture to launch and quit the browser.</li>
<li>The class Factory from actions.py represents the user actions and and determines the behavior of the program.</li>
<li>The main.py contains the tests that are carried out.</li>
</ul>
Factory class result depends on the number of introduced variables: 
<ol>
<li>If both variables are entered, the function checks whether the url has changed from the login page to the welcome page or not.</li>
<li>If a single variable is entered, the function returns a variable that contains data about the occurrence of a warning.</li>
</ol>
